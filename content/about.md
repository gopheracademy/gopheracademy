## Gopher Academy
Gopher Academy's mission is to foster a community of Go developers by providing education, training, and events.

Founded in 2012 by long time Gophers [Brian Ketelsen](https://twitter.com/bketelsen) and [Erik St. Martin](https://twitter.com/erikstmartin), Gopher Academy exists because we believe in the Go programming language. More importantly, we see the opportunity to help shape a community that is inclusive, welcoming, helpful, and vibrant.
